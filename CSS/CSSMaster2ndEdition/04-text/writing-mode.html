          <h2>Setting Block Flow Direction with the <code>writing-mode</code> property</h2>
          <p>Writing mode sets the <em>block flow direction</em> or the direction in which block-level boxes and table rows are ordered on the screen or page. It also determines whether lines of text within those boxes are arranged horizontally or vertically. Its initial value is <code>horizontal-tb</code>, which is a shorthand for <q>horizontal, top to bottom.</q></p>

          <h1>When the value of <code>writing-mode</code> is <code>horizontal-tb</code></h1>
          <p>Blocks are stacked top-to-bottom. This is the initial value, and the writing mode of most text on the web.</p>

          <p>Lines of text may flow left-to-right as with Latin, Devanagari, or Sinhala scripts. Or lines may flow right-to-left, as with Hebrew and Arabic script.</p>

        <section class="vertical__lr">
           <h1>When the value of <code>writing-mode</code> is <code>vertical-lr</code></h1>
          <p>Block ordering begins at the left of the container, and blocks stack rightward. Lines of text are vertically-oriented. Characters from scripts that have a native horizontal orientation (e.g. Latin script) are rotated by 90&deg;. That can be changed with the <a href="text-orientation.html"><code>text-orientation</code></a> property.</p>

          <p>Mongolian, when written using Mongolian script, is an example of a language that may use a vertical, left-to-right writing mode. Mongolian may also be written using Cyrillic script. When written using Cyrillic, Mongolian is read and written horizontally, but also from left-to-right.</p>

          <h1>When the value of <code>writing-mode</code> is <code>vertical-rl</code></h1>

          <p>Block ordering begins at the right of the container, and blocks stack leftward. Lines of text are vertically-oriented. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean may be written horizontally <em>or</em> vertically. When written vertically, these languages are usually written and read from right-to-left. Here too, characters from scripts that have a native horizontal orientation (e.g. Latin script) are rotated by 90&deg;.</p>

          <p>Korean is a language that may be read and written vertically, from right-to-left.</p>

          <p>Block ordering begins at the left of the container, and blocks stack rightward. Lines of text are vertically-oriented.</p>

          <p>This differs from <code>writing-mode: vertical-lr</code> because <em>all characters</em>, are rotated 90&deg;. Characters are displayed sideways regardless of their native orientation.</p>
