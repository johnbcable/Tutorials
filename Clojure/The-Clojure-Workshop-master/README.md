## About The Clojure Workshop
You already know you want to learn Clojure, and a smart way to learn Clojure is to learn by doing. The Clojure Workshop focuses on building up your practical skills so that you can write clean, expressive code with a language that is great for applications where concurrency and interoperability with the JVM are a priority. You'll learn from real examples that lead to real results. 

## What you will learn
* Learn about Clojure fundamentals like functional programming 
* Understand and implement common Clojure patterns and best practices 
* Explore Clojure’s testing infrastructure and the clojure.test library 
* Build a client-server application with Clojure and ClojureScript 
* Learn how to debug and resolve errors and exceptions 
* Explore Ring – Clojure's interface and library for building web applications
