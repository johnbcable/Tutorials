# error-handling

Testing error handling in ClojureSript.

## Setup

Most of the following scripts require [rlwrap](http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/) (on OS X installable via brew).

1. Build your project once in dev mode with the following script:

    ./scripts/build

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. In the console tab in the browser page you will see the tests summary. Similar to the following:

    `Testing error-handling.core`

    `Ran 2 tests containing 5 assertions.`

    `0 failures, 0 errors.`
